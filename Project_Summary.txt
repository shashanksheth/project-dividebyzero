Team Members: Amber An, Mrudula Chinta, Shashank Sheth, Trey Warren Elson

Project Description:
•	Compare median rent and $/sf of dwelling units in each city
	o	Factor in ‘like’ apartments (similar amenities and surrounding neighborhood)
	o	Compare the sale price versus rent price of condos 

Research Questions:
•	How have rents changed over time? 
•	How do prices affect the demographics? 
	o	Correlation or causation? Gentrification?  
•	Does it seem like there is a more preferred unit type in each city?
•	How does restaurant/educational building density affect prices in each neighborhood?
	o	Correlation or causation? Chicken or the egg?
•	How do walkscores affect prices in each neighborhood?
	o	Correlation or causation? 
•	Are there comparable neighborhoods between SF and NYC?

Datasets to be used: 
	Zillow API: https://www.zillow.com/howto/api/APIOverview.htm
	Walkscore API : https://www.walkscore.com/professional/api.php
	Yelp Fusion
	Google Maps

	Census 
	Data.gov https://www.data.gov/
	Community API https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/community-api-product/1/overview
( this will help us get useful insights about a specific region,but need to infer such local data as income, education, crime)
	
Rough breakdown of tasks: 
•	Use Pandas to read the data
•	Clean and reformat the data
•	Attempt to merge all datasets that can be easily grouped by similar indices
•	Quantitative analysis
•	Create plots to better describe the data
•	Qualitative analysis
